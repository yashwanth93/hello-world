hello-world, it's Siraj!


This is an unbiased but a subjective opinion :P

Lewis seems to be really on it only after few initial hiccups and then comes back really strong. When he is on it, he is just unbeatable. But the amount of criticism he receives from the journalists and fans is quite unbelievable, this guy rides on emotions and that's why he has got the number of fans that he has and honestly F1 just won't be the same once he reires even if there amzing young talents like Max, Charles etc. It is the emotions and personality which connects people and his retirement will be a huge loss not just for F1 but also for the fans who look for inspiration in their day-to-day lives, constantly seeking for improvement and looking up to sports stars like Lewis who is just a true inspiratioon in many ways. People should judge him for what he is rather than how he looks or where he lives. Having read, watched and listened to many interviews of different F1 drivers, he is truly remarkable and not one connects with my personality in the way he does!
